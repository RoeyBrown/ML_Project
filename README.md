# Waste Management Analysis Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project applies supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and predict environmental impacts based on industrial waste management data. Models were trained to classify environmental impact levels and identify patterns and anomalies in waste treatment and disposal practices.

Key Features
Supervised Models: Predict environmental impact using XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Unsupervised Models: Discover patterns and detect anomalies using K-Means and DBSCAN.
Feature Engineering: Custom environmental impact classification based on waste treatment and disposal metrics.
Insights: Actionable findings to optimize waste management practices and support policy decisions.
